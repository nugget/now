# OpenHAB Experimenting

I stopped running OpenHAB on a Linux VM and instead moved it to my Raspberry Pi
that I've been using to interface with my DSC Alarm system.  The Pi is way
slower but I needed access to the serial port that's hooked up to my IT-100.

# Rebuilding my atrophied home theater system

Adding components as I can, and now documented on [a web page](/avgear)

# Automating the mechanism I use to update this list

The contents of this list are now tracked in a plain old markdown file that
I keep in github.  I wrote a little shell script that automates the editing,
committing, and pushing of the file contents.  The web site is just sourcing
that file now and presenting it.

Now I just need to figure out how to better style the output for readability.

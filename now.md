# Home Automation Expermenting

I'm teaching myself proper Python and learning asyncio so that I can apply
those skills towards [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) work.  My
first project, starting small, is an asyncio library to integrate my Anthem
MRX 1120 with Home Assistant.  This takes the form of a Python package 
([python-anthemav](https://github.com/nugget/python-anthemav)) as the back end
for an [anthemavr home assistant Platform](https://github.com/nugget/home-assistant/blob/anthemav/homeassistant/components/media_player/anthemav.py).

I've got the plumbing working really well, but I haven't tackled the front end
yet.  I'm pleased with my progress so far, though, and I'm enjoying doing some
more advanced Python development than I've done previously.

If this goes smoothly, I intend to also make platforms for the DSC IT-100 as
well as the Insteon USB PLM.  The Insteon should be a popular addition to Home
Assistant if I can get it going soon.

# Time Spent on My Feet

In December I really started ramping my running miles back up.  I have two
goals I'd like to approach in 2017.  I want to run a sub-4 hour marathon and
get myself back into fighting shape for another Rocky Raccoon 100 attempt.  No
timeframe on either, I'm just going to see how it goes.

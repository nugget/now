# Home Automation Expermenting

I'm teaching myself proper Python and learning asyncio so that I can apply
those skills towards [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) work.

My pull request to add platform support for [Anthem MRX and AVR
devices](https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player.anthemav/) was
accepted into the project in the last release (0.37).  Buoyed by that success
I've started working on a much more involved addition in the form of an INSTEON
PLM component to suppor the older USB/Serial based PowerLinc Modem devices.

I'm optimistically hoping to get it working in time for 0.39 towards the end of
the month.  Most of the work right now is within the underlying
[Python insteonplm package](https://github.com/nugget/python-insteonplm).

# Time Spent on My Feet

In December I really started ramping my running miles back up.  I have two
goals I'd like to approach in 2017.  I want to run a sub-4 hour marathon and
get myself back into fighting shape for another Rocky Raccoon 100 attempt.  No
timeframe on either, I'm just going to see how it goes.

I've done two successive weeks now with 20+ mile long runs, and I'm hovering
right around the 45-50 mile per week level.  After being sidelined due to
injury for over a year, it feels fantastic to be back out the door without any
real issues.

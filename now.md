# Home Automation Expermenting

After an aborted attempt with OpenHAB I'm now fiddling with using
[Indigo](https://www.indigodomo.com) on a MacBook Air macOS Server for 
coordinating my Insteon, zwave, and Philips Hue devices.  I've been eyeing
Home Assistant as well, but leaning towards just sticking with Indigo for
convenience.
